		<h4>Part One: Identifying Turtles</h4>
		
		<h4 id="common_snapper">Common Snapper</h4>
		<p>The common snapper is by far the most common species of turtle found on earth. They come in unappealing shades of green and brown, with the occasional pink one. Common snappers are named for their numbers, and their distinctive jaw shape, hence the "common snapper." Common snappers can be found virtually anywhere, from ponds to puddles, mountains and valleys, and even on the streets. If you choose to befriend one and keep it as a pet, bear in mind that common snappers are very aggresive and do not hesitite to snap their jaws when they feel threatened. Pink common snappers are very rare, and are highly treasured for their color, however they do not have the distinct jaw shape that common snappers have, and are more vulnerable to predators, which is why their numbers are so few.</p>

		<h4 id="three_horned_snapper">Three Horned Snapper</h4>
		<p>Unlike their pointy jawed cousins, three horned snappers sport a trio of sharp horns on their head, and are relatively more uncommon because they are hunted for their horns. Three horned snappers also come in similar colors, ranging from greens to browns. If you see a three horned snapper and would like to befriend it, please, please, PLEASE bear in mind that you should never approach one without caution, as they are very intensive and aggresive when threatened. If you charge at one, they will bare their fangs and stab you with their vicious horns. However, when properly tamed, they make wonderful pets and will loyally serve you for the rest of their lives.</p>

		<h4 id="gill_swimmer">Gill Swimmer</h4>
		<p>Gill swimmers, commonly mistaken for tortoises, are a fascinating species of turtles. On land, they are brown and clumsy, but in water, they turn beautiful shades of turquoise and blue. They have three pairs of flippers, unlike other turtle species, which means they can propel themselves at high speeds in the water. These make fantastic pets, and are very playful and friendly. Just keep in mind that they require constant attention or will transform into unattractive shade of blue. Also, please remember to provide your pet turtle with plenty of fresh water and squids.</p>

		<h4 id="winged_flyer">Winged Flyer</h4>
		<p>Although most turtles prefer to remain on the ground, and get airsick easily, these turtles would rather be in the air then anyone else. Winged flyers come in many shades of white and grey, and sport a magnificent set of wings. These turtles live high up in mountain ranges or secluded forests. They are very solitary, and prefer to be left alone. However, these turtles form small groups of five and form very close bonds with their groupmates. If you choose to raise winged turtles as your pets, it might be wise to befriend them all at once, as they are very hostile to anyone who dares to approach one of their friends.</p> 


		<h4 id="legendary_rainbow">Legendary Rainbow</h4>
		<p>These are by far the rarest turtles in existence. Legendary rainbows once populated the world, but they were hunted to extinction for their golden shells. Now, it's unknown whether these turtles still exist, but there has been evidence of these magnificent creatures roaming the earth still. They have rainbow skin and golden shells, and each sports a pair of huge white wings. They prefer to live solitary lives and it is possible for them to live their life without ever meeting another turtle. If you want to raise one, the best option is probably to cross your fingers and hope one finds its way to you, because believe me, you won't be finding any out in the wild.</p>

		<h4 id="how_to_care_for_your_turtle">How to Care for Your Turtle</h4>

		<p>If you've read this far, I'm going to make one of two assumptions, either you're bored and reading this webpage just to kill time, or you've actually managed to befriend a turtle and it is now chewing your couch. Or you're genuinely interested in this stuff which is probably not the case. Well, lets assume that you have a turtle. The first step to taming your new friend is to give it lots of love so that you start forming a bond. Please refrain from stepping on your turtle, starving it, or yelling at the poor creature. Make sure to pet your turtle, brush it's hair, and give it plenty of food and water everyday. If you take your turtle for a walk to get some fresh air, it'll be even happier. Once you've started to form a bond, you can start with gentle disciplinary lessons. Please try to hold your temper and very gentyly instruct the turtle to please not bite the cat's tail. Give it a treat every time it obeys, and it'll be obedient in no time. Finally, you want to set aside some time for your turtle every day. You can go swimming, play cards, draw pictures, etc<br>Happy turtle raising!</p>
